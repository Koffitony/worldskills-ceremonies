      "text": "<p>Cabinetmaking covers the manufacture of free-standing and built-in furniture and units, using wood at the sole or main material. It may include the design of furniture, but normally comprises the creation of furniture and units from designs prepared by others. Cabinetmaking differs from joinery through the quality of the wood and associated materials used, and the intricacy and aesthetic quality of the finished items. There is, however, some overlap between cabinetmaking and joinery.</p>\n\n<p>A cabinetmaker generally works on commercial and residential assignments of a high quality and value. He or she will therefore exhibit very high standards of skill and professionalism in order to justify clients&rsquo; expectations and willingness to pay. Most cabinetmakers work in small companies which have to be very sensitive to their reputation and market in order to sustain their businesses&rsquo; viability.</p>\n\n<p>The cabinetmaker will produce furniture and fittings in a workshop, at least until installing fitted items. However, in order to meet clients&rsquo; needs, including for the items to add to the aesthetic qualities of their environment they will be placed in, he or she will know intimately where bespoke items are intended to be placed. For items produced speculatively rather than for known clients, the cabinetmaker will have a clear view of the types of location and setting that will show the items at their best.</p>\n\n<p>The cabinetmaker will produce, interpret and/or adapt drawings, set out and measure, cut, form joints, assemble, install if need be, and finish to a high standard. The quality of his/her work will show in:</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The selection of the wood and other materials</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placing of the wood to bring out its particular characteristics</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction techniques which allow for the natural movement of timber to achieve longevity and quality in the furniture piece</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The selection of additional materials including veneers and fittings</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The near-perfect fit of each part following accurate measurement, cutting and assembly, and</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final appearance of the item</p>\n\n<p>Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation and creativity, working precisely and accurately are the universal attributes of the cabinetmaker. He or she assumes a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From working safely through to exceptional planning and organizing, accuracy, concentration and attention to detail to achieve an excellent finish every step in the process matters and mistakes are largely irreversible and very costly.</p>\n\n<p>Modern technology and mass production have enabled furniture and fittings, previously available only to the wealthy, to be more widely available. However, for those with disposable income and an eye for quality, the cabinetmaker is able to produce furniture and fittings that are a lasting pleasure both to use and to look at. In this discerning market the outstanding cabinetmaker will always be in demand.</p>\n"

He or she may offer a range of services, including interpreting client requirements/drawings, advising on designs/colours, painting, spraying, decorative coatings, wallpapering, gilding and sign writing to a high standard.</p>\n\n<p>Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation, creativity, and the ability to prepare surfaces thoroughly with meticulous care and work accurately are the universal attributes of the outstanding painter and decorator. In a mobile labour market, the painter and decorator may work in teams, or alone, or in both from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced painter and decorator takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From carefully determining the requirements of the client, working safely and tidily, exceptional planning and scheduling, precision and attention to detail to the fine gilding of objects and finishing of furniture, every process matters and mistakes are largely irreversible and costly.</p>\n\n<p>With the international mobility of people, the painter and decorator faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges.

Traditional plastering involves the preparation of the background prior to application of the plaster surface. The plasterer will prepare materials for use and be fully aware of legislation and official guidance relating to the preparation and use of materials. In addition to plastering flat surfaces, the skilled plasterer will create and install decorative mouldings. Plasterers will also be required to make repairs.</p>\n\n<p>The plasterer may work on large construction sites for domestic, commercial or industrial use, in single domestic and commercial premises or on historic buildings and heritage sites. Much plastering work on larger sites is sub-contracted and as such many skilled plasterers will be self-employed, meaning that they have to take responsibility for tax and other earnings related regulation.</p>\n\n<p>A high degree of accuracy, care and skill is required. Preparation for plastering work will include complex mathematical calculations. The practitioner needs to be able to read, interpret and analyse complex specifications describing the work required and be able to convert these plans into reality.</p>\n\n<p>A range of materials can be used depending on the site and the planned use of the finished building. Some materials can be harmful, so care must always be taken by the plasterer to prevent injury or damage in use or disposal of waste.</p>\n\n<p>Plasterers often form part of a team, working efficiently and effectively with other skilled craftsmen in a logical and well planned manner.</p>\n"

Tiling is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The tiler works internally and externally, including in the homes of customers and on building sites, in all weather conditions and on small and major projects. The work includes the laying of tiles of ceramics, mosaic and natural stone on walls, floors and staircases in houses, commercial, industrial and public buildings, churches, swimming pools, outside installations and fa&ccedil;ades to provide protective and decorative finishes. It also includes the construction of small walls and steps from bricks or blocks.</p>\n\n<p>The tiler will interpret drawings, set out and measure, remove any existing covering, prepare surfaces, lay the tiles in the desired pattern, grout and finish to a high standard. Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation and creativity, and working accurately are the universal attributes of the outstanding tiler. Whether the tiler is working alone (many are self-employed or sub-contractors) or in a team on large projects, the individual takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. Experienced tilers may also specialize in one area of work such as mosaics and they can work for specialist tiling firms specializing for example in artistic work or competition swimming pools.</p>\n\n<p>From working safely and tidily through to exceptional planning and scheduling, concentration, precision, accuracy and attention to detail to achieve an excellent finish, every step in the process matters. Mistakes are largely irreversible and can be very costly</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;With the international mobility of people the tiler faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented tiler there are many commercial and international opportunities; however these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures and trends. The diversity of skills associated with tilers is therefore likely to expand.</p>\n"

      "text": "<p>The Fashion Technology practitioner creates garments. The technical skills involved include design, pattern construction, cutting and garment manufacture.</p>\n\n<p>The practitioner may work in one of several sectors but often they are self-employed and work on commissioned projects or in the retail manufacturing sector or in sampling garments for production. As such they need to have business acumen and strong interpersonal skills when dealing with clients. Excellent customer care and selling skills are crucial. As some work is often commissioned for important events, the practitioner must understand the needs of the client and be able to offer appropriate expert advice whilst interpreting the vision for the finished project. Customer briefs must be clearly understood and followed accurately.</p>\n\n<p>Fabrics are often expensive, delicate and easily damaged or handled incorrectly. Given this, the practitioner must be respectful of the raw materials with which they work and apply extensive knowledge of effective sourcing, purchasing, handling and storage of all materials. Sustainability, ethics and budgets are all serious considerations when sourcing materials and selecting sub-contractors.</p>\n\n<p>The design of a garment requires innovation, creativity and artistic and design talents that incorporate aesthetics and practicalities. The practitioner must apply the rules and theory of composition including design elements and principles as well as technique. He or she is often creative and artistic, with a good eye for design and the ability to create pleasing and functional garments, suitable for their purpose. In addition, a thorough knowledge and understanding of specialist equipment and its use is essential. Another requirement is a high level of technical knowledge in patternmaking and construction techniques. Different fabrics will react in various ways to the manufacturing process and these characteristics must be considered throughout the preparation and production process.</p>\n\n<p>There is a wide range of practice in the fashion sector. Some practitioners produce small ranges for retail outlets or high class fashion houses or prepare bespoke garments ordered by individual clients. At the other end of the professional spectrum, the practitioner may work in an industrial setting, producing prototypes for mass production. Practice also varies across the world. The fashion industry is truly global: for example, a garment may be designed and prototyped in one country and sub-contracted for manufacture in another.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever employed, it is essential that the practitioner is aware of current and emerging fashions and trends in the fashion industry. Equally important is an awareness of new developments in fabrics and textiles as well as machinery and equipment. Significant damage can be done to a business and its reputation if fashion trends are misread.</p>\n"

As such they need to have business acumen and excellent interpersonal skills when dealing with clients. Excellent levels of customer care and sales skills are crucial.

The florist must apply the rules and theory of composition, colour and technique as valid by the floristry trade worldwide, and show clear ideas (principles and elements of floral design) in his/her works.</p>\n\n<p>The florist will use their expertise and knowledge of flowers, plants, botanical materials and accessories to produce floral works. There is a wide scope of practice in industry. Some florists will work in retail outlets and prepare bouquets and arrangements speculatively for sale and must therefore be keenly aware of their market. At the other end of the professional spectrum, a florist may be commissioned to provide floral displays for major high profile international events that require interpreting a theme and working effectively with a large team and other professionals in a high pressure situation with tight time limitations.</p>\n"

They will therefore need to be able to correctly interpret these drawings to create a jewellery piece as envisioned by the designer. A jewellery maker must be able to respect the shapes and forms of the designer&rsquo;s original concept and should be able to interact with the designer, giving and receiving feedback regarding the manufacturing process. A jewellery maker&rsquo;s skill-set does not necessarily require direct contact with clients as there will usually be intermediaries involved.</p>\n\n<p>A jewellery maker may also be required to replicate a piece directly, or use jewellery making skills to renovate or repair an existing piece.</p>\n\n<p>Dealing with precious metals, a jewellery maker needs to be precise, work economically and avoid wastage of materials. The work is intricately detailed and requires a high level of skill, focus and concentration. Once the jewellery maker has finished a piece it may progress to further phases of the manufacturing process requiring goldsmith&rsquo;s industry skills other than jewellery making, such as gem-setting and casting.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason a jewellery maker must have some knowledge and understanding of other goldsmith&rsquo;s industry skills. They must, for example, have an appreciation of gemstones, their characteristics, cuts, uses and impact on the finished piece. Similarly they must be aware of the different phases of reproduction through casting.</p>\n\n<p>Jewellery makers will work in a goldsmith&rsquo;s workshop using specialist tools and equipment. Due to the intricate nature of the work, many of the tools are delicate and therefore need to be used and handled with extreme care. Some jewellery makers may be independent, but more often they will work in a workshop with other jewellery makers or technicians with other specialist goldsmith&rsquo;s industry skills. They must always observe skill-specific health and safety procedures and regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Jewellery is made from precious metals and gemstones, which are highly valuable. A jewellery maker must therefore act with complete honesty and integrity and be fully aware of security and the regulations relating to the purchase, production and sale of precious metals, gemstones and finished pieces.</p>\n"

The chief aim of a visual merchandiser is to maximize sales by communicating with the target audience and creating a positive atmosphere. The visual merchandiser communicates directly with the target audience through their designs and creates a positive impression which in turn impacts on the sales revenue of the business. Whilst not possible to precisely measure the impact of the visual merchandiser&rsquo;s displays it is accepted that they are an increasingly important element of the marketing and sales mix of a successful retail business.</p>\n\n<p>The visual merchandiser works in retail outlets, which are part of a group with central support functions and in small independent shops where there is greater personal autonomy and responsibility. The activities a visual merchandiser undertakes are based on interpreting and researching a brief, creating a design, and implementation - working with the products and their props.</p>\n\n<p>Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation and creativity: the ability to develop original &lsquo;eye-catching&rsquo; concepts with the WOW factor which positively engage the target market and attention to detail/perfection are the universal attributes of the outstanding visual merchandiser.</p>\n\n<p>The visual merchandiser may work in teams or alone, depending on the size of the business. In medium to large businesses they work very closely with marketing and sales teams. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced visual merchandiser takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From understanding the goals and targets of marketing and sales departments, interpreting the Brief correctly and understanding the behaviour of target markets to creating a display with the WOW factor every stage in the visual merchandising process matters and displays have a close relationship with sales revenues.</p>\n\n<p>With the globalization of visual imagery and the international mobility of people, the visual merchandiser faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented visual merchandiser there are many commercial and international opportunities; however these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures, trends and fashions. The diversity of skills associated with visual merchandising is therefore likely to expand.</p>\n"

Web Designers develop a professional relationship with their clients, interacting with them in order to develop a deep understanding of the requirements and convert these into a website specification. Strong design and communication skills, coupled with research techniques and a grasp of target audiences, markets and trends, will ensure initial client satisfaction and credibility for the Web Designer.</p>\n\n<p>Having completed the website planning and design, the Web Designer then integrates the website with third party tools and platforms.

This can range from being a self-employed freelancer to being employed by media organizations and advertising agencies. Web Designer positions may be broad in scope or specialize in an area such as Graphic Design, Client Management, Front End Development, Back End/Server Side Development and User End Designer.

However, to excel they must have a strong grasp of copyright law and a well-developed personal code of ethics. They must understand artistic values, and take personal responsibility for being constantly at the forefront of trends and web technology. They must also be responsive to clients and have the ability to work in structured and unstructured teams and groups.

It is present in products and objects of everyday life as e.g. cars, airplanes, components of machines of all types, moulds for tools used for household machines, medical prosthetics, cell phones and toys etc.</p>\n\n<p>CNC milling machines are machine tools which are used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials. These machines exist in two basic forms: horizontal and vertical. This refers to the orientation of the cutting tool spindle. Early milling machines were manually or mechanically automated, but technological advances have led to the development of Computer Numerical Control, such as CNC machining centre. CNC refers to a computer (&ldquo;control&rdquo;) that reads and stores instructions. This numerical information generally &ldquo;G and M&rdquo; codes (a programing language) is then used to control and drives a machine tool, a powered mechanical device (&ldquo;machining centre&rdquo;). A machining centre is used to fabricate components using cutting tools for removal of material.</p>\n\n<p>CNC technology includes machining tools such as lathes, multi-axis spindles, wire electrical discharge machines and milling machines, where the functions formerly performed by human operators are now performed by a computer control module. The professionals associated with this skill use CNC machines (3-Axis, 4-5 Axis or Multi-Axis machines) to cut and shape precision products as mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>To form the finished part, the cutting process can be started from a solid block, pre-machined part, casting or forgings. For those scenarios, the skill requires the CNC milling machinist to read and interpret complex technical drawings and specifications and work to a high degree of precision and detail; to be proficient at metal work skills and understand how metals react to various processes; to be a skilled computer operator in order to use industry specific software; to be highly skilled machine operator.</p>\n\n<p>A program is required to operate the machine tool, can be generated manually or using Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacture (CAD/CAM) software.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve the finished part the CNC milling machinist professionals undertake a sequence of essential activities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Interpret engineering drawings and follow the specifications</li>\n\t<li>Generate a process and program (logical process plan) with a CAD/CAM system and/or G and M-codes</li>\n\t<li>Set up the tooling, work holding device and work piece on the CNC milling centre</li>\n\t<li>Manipulate cutting conditions, based on the properties of the material and tooling used</li>\n\t<li>Operate, inspect and maintain the accuracy of dimensions within the specified tolerances</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Optimize the process taking into account the production type: large quantities of one part, small batches or one-of-a-kind items.</p>\n\n<p>Today a wide range of industries require CNC milling machinists professionals to program, operate and keep sophisticated machining centre&rsquo;s running in an efficient and reliable way. Large enterprises such as automobile plants, medium sized enterprises such as mould making and small enterprises in the maintenance field are some of many examples of where the CNC milling machinist professional plays a key, integral role to the success of the metalwork industries.</p>\n"

      "text": "<p>CNC Turning is a branch of engineering. Engineers have to find mechanical solutions that can make complex designs possible. Within an assembly that you may see and use every day, every single part interacts with every other. This is true of cars, Smartphones, aircraft, and so on; the possibilities are endless. For example, there are about 10,000 parts in just one car. Engineers create assemblies of many parts, and using many different materials, through CAD (Computer Assisted Drawing) software.</p>\n\n<p>Each part of an assembly is made of different materials, and needs different geometries, dimensions and surface qualities. The engineer brings all these requirements into technical drawings which are called &ldquo;blueprints&rdquo;. But who will build these parts? To answer that question we have to decide the best way to produce each part. There are many ways of doing this, like welding, milling, casting, and 3D Printing. One very important method is CNC Turning.</p>\n\n<p>A CNC Lathe is a machine on which material turns around an axis at high speed, and where cutting tools driven by computer software are moved to cut away excessive material to get the expected part. The CNC Turning Machinist receives the blueprint. Then he/she uses the Lathe in many ways to find solutions in order to build the part. These machines are very expensive, because they can do remarkable things. To have an idea of this, think what it means to achieve accuracy below 10 microns, which is six times thinner than a human hair.</p>\n\n<p>The CNC Turning Machinist has to use a computer to tell the Lathe how to move the tools and cut the part. He/she also has to set up the Lathe with all the cutting tools. These tools can cut almost every material (stainless steel, plastic, soft steel, aluminium, bronze, and so on) but we have to choose well. We also choose the clamping method. This is where the material will be held firm.</p>\n\n<p>When the machine starts cutting material, the Machinist makes sure that the dimensions exactly fit the blueprint specifications. For this, very accurate inspection tools are used. A smart Machinist will get the part to fit the blueprint specifications at the first attempt.</p>\n\n<p>The finished and quality controlled part is sent to the assembly line with every other part, and in the end, if everyone has done their job well, the finished assembly will meet expectations and please its customers.</p>\n"

Some technicians/engineers will work across many aspects of electronics, but increasing specialization and technical developments means that specialist technician/engineers are widely employed. The key areas of specialism which can be seen as careers in their own right include the assembly and wiring of electronic products; the designing of prototype circuits to specifications; the installation and commissioning of equipment including the provision of customer support; service and maintenance which include a service both in situ and remotely; and monitoring and testing to specifications sub-assemblies or systems and approving fit-for-purpose and simulating outcomes on computers.</p>\n\n<p>Electronics specialists need to work in a wide range of industries by supporting highly technical specialist equipment. These industries include:</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aerospace/aeronautics</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The military</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robotics</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audio/TV/entertainment</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratories and hospitals</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher education research laboratories</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communications and telecommunications</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transport</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security</p>\n\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturing including instrumentation</p>\n\n<p>Electronics technicians/engineers must work with a high degree of accuracy and precision, conforming to detailed specifications and international quality standards and demonstrating extensive technical ability. Due to the constant developments in technology, the electronics technician/engineer needs to be proactive in ensuring that his/her skills and knowledge are up-to-date and meet industry standards and expectations. The technician/engineer may work directly with clients and will therefore need to demonstrate excellent customer service and communication skills and work effectively to time schedules. When working with clients, the technician/engineer may have to explain elements of complex electronics principles to assist the client to use equipment correctly. Often the nature of the establishment in which the electronics expert works will require him/her to respect confidentiality with respect to highly commercially sensitive information and to demonstrate integrity, honesty and a strong ethical sense.</p>\n\n<p>The electronics specialist will work with a wide range of tools, specialist hi-tech equipment and materials. Increasingly, computers and specialist software for communications technology is embedded into the work. In addition, tasks will also require the use of specialist hand tools for the assembly and maintenance of circuits and surface mounted technology.</p>\n"

While each specialism has value in its own right, each team member requires additional attributes. The capacity to work within and contribute to a team is vital, requiring both self-understanding and interpersonal skills. Team members also need the ability to think beyond their own specialisms and the boundaries of each skill, in order to make the most of the team&rsquo;s combined efforts.</p>\n\n<p>This skill has exceptional value as an exemplar of modern manufacturing practices. Whatever the size or sector of the manufacturing organization, continuous improvement and innovation are key to its survival and prosperity. These features do not happen in isolation, but through the combined efforts of high level, insightful specialists. Where diverse manufacturing teams are most successful, this will also be due to the inclusion within the team of both broad and specific financial and organizational skills. These skills will strictly control time and cost while seeking at all times to go beyond the client&rsquo;s expectations for quality.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever their specialism, members of successful manufacturing teams have the opportunity to generate the skills normally associated with accelerated promotion and management development. As the skills also associated with successful enterprise, they open up many positive career choices within the labour market and economy.</p>\n"

Mobile robotics is an important part of the industry, with applications in diverse industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, aerospace, mining, and medicine.</p>\n\n<p>A robotics engineer works in offices, manufacturing plants or laboratories; he or she designs, maintains, develops new applications and conducts research to expand the potential for robots. The role begins with a strong focus on a specific business problem, in a particular sector. For example in manufacturing there may be a need to increase capacity by creating robots for tasks that can be automated. Mobile robots may also be designed to explore areas that are inaccessible or dangerous for human beings.</p>\n\n<p>Careful, deep client consultation is required, resulting in an accurate specification. The design phase follows and a prototype is assembled. The robot is then programmed and tested to ensure high, consistent performance. At the heart of every robot is a robotics engineer who thinks about what a robot needs to do and works with several engineering disciplines to design and put together the optimal piece of equipment, demonstrating a commitment to attention to detail. In this instance the robotics engineer uses existing technologies to create solutions to new challenges. He or she is not creating new (robot) technology.</p>\n\n<p>Robotics engineers must be familiar with logic, microprocessors, and computer programming so that they can design the right robot for each application. They must also prepare specifications for the robot&#39;s capabilities as they relate to the work environment. In addition, robotics engineers are responsible for cost efficient design, cost-price calculations and quality-control.</p>\n\n<p>Integral to the role of the high performing robotics engineer are a range of skills related to work organization and self-management. Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a particular strength in working well in a team, are equally important. An ability to be innovative and creative in resolving technological challenges and generating solutions is also essential.</p>\n\n<p>Working across sectors internationally and being able to transfer analytical skills is a feature of the excellent robotics engineer, together with a commitment to continuing specialist and professional development and a determination to resolve problems through experimenting and risk taking within self-managed boundaries. In an increasingly global industry, which is &lsquo;breaking new ground&rsquo; and altering the way we live and work, there are significant opportunities for sustainable careers in robotics engineering. The opportunities carry with them the need to work with diverse cultures, industries and fast paced technological change. The diversity of skills associated with robotics engineering is therefore likely to expand.</p>\n"

      "text": "<p>Plastic Die Engineers are engaged in the mass production of plastic products of high quality but low cost. This is achieved by producing a mould based on drawings by a competent designer who understands Design for Manufacturing and assembly principles, having hands on injection moulding, mould making, plastic part design and mould design software experiences.</p>\n\n<p>The designing and processing of a mould is done with the help of CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) systems. Most of the machining is done on CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining centres. The machined parts are then polished according to requirements and assembled to keep them ready for trial. Completed moulds will be installed in an injection moulding machine, and then plastic products are manufactured.</p>\n\n<p>This is a very rewarding profession. Plastic Die Engineers are increasingly in demand. An industrial market research consultancy specializing in plastic products and appliances, predicts that the world&rsquo;s use of commodity plastic will reach 510 million tons in 2020. Plastic Die Engineering is a fast paced world which is highly creative and full of opportunities for skilled and talented people. It is an essential aspect of engineering because most plastic parts cannot be made without a die. Therefore Plastic Die Engineers are a critical link in the overall plastic injection moulding process.</p>\n\n<p>Light weight, availability of various designs and cost reduction are the greatest advantages to industries. These days, from smart phones to automobiles, since there are so many different fields of industries that plastic die engineering is involved, the demand for plastic die engineering has significantly increased. Plastic injection moulded components are also used in telecommunications, medical, aerospace and automobile industries, for home appliances, office automation, entertainment and electronics. Thus the range of different fields of requirements provide many challenges, ranging from modelling of the product, designing the die, to manufacturing it, inspection and the trouble shooting of moulding defects for good mass production.</p>\n\n<p>The skilled practitioner needs excellent levels of skill in numeracy, hand and machining skill, polishing, assembling, testing and troubleshooting.</p>\n"

They need to gain specific knowledge of a wide range of welding equipment and processes as well as a good working knowledge of metallurgy. They need to be familiar with electricity and electrical processes.</p>\n\n<p>Welders join sections, pipe and plate and fabricate large and small pressure vessels. A welder prepares, assembles and joins a wide range of metals and metal alloys using various welding processes including MMAW (manual metal arc welding), MAGSW (metal arc gas shielded welding), TAGSW (Tungsten arc gas shielded welding) gas welding and cutting. They use gas, electrical, and gas shielded electrical processes to join and cut a wide range of materials. They must be able to choose and operate the correct equipment, process and methodology depending upon the material being joined.</p>\n\n<p>Welders may be engaged in using thermal cutting processes and should be able to identify and follow the correct preparation for joining as applied to the type, thickness and intended use of the joint. They use grinding and cutting equipment to prepare and finish welded joints. Modern methods of joining, as well as those noted above, include mechanized processes such as submerged arc, plasma arc, stud welding and laser welding.</p>\n\n<p>A welder can work in a unit or factory which produces fabrications and/or structures for industries as diverse as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, transport, marine engineering, and construction, service and leisure industries. Welders also work on site preparation, construction, and the repair and maintenance of structures within the areas described above. A welder can work in many locations and situations, ranging from a bench in a factory, to shipyards, power stations and off-shore structures in order to inspect and repair gas or oil rig terminals. Welders also work in engineering, construction, power generating and petro-chemical plants. The working environment may include hazardous settings such as the open sea.</p>\n\n<p>The modern welder may specialize in one or a number of welding processes and environments. He or she may also be asked to work in exotic alloys such as duplex stainless steels and cupronickels. The quality of the welding will vary according to cost and function, with the most skilled welders depended upon to carry out the finest work where faults and failure may have the most serious consequences in terms of cost, safety and environmental damage.</p>\n"

The specialist services and treatments offered by the beauty therapist relate to the: face, body, feet, hands and nails. The beauty therapist may specialize, for example in manicure or pedicure. Irrespective of this, work organization and management, professional attitude, client care and relationships are the universal attributes of the outstanding beauty therapist.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty therapist works in a 1:1 relationship with clients and can be part of a wider team. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced beauty therapist takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy.

The range of skills and customer expectations will vary according to the work-place. There is also a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service provided and the payment made by the customer or corporate client. As well as the skill of cooking, the role of a chef will also demand further skills that relate to cooking in a commercial setting and therefore working to a budget or expected profit margin. These skills include menu compilation and costing, control and correct storage of stock, planning work for self and others and managing a kitchen brigade.</p>\n\n<p>The chef in a high class hotel or restaurant offering fine dining will need to demonstrate outstanding skills in food preparation and presentation. They will be expected to create and adapt dishes that meet the expectations of demanding customers who are used to dining in exclusive restaurants. Fashions and trends in cuisine fluctuate so it is important that the top class chef keeps abreast of these trends and adapts their product and service accordingly. The customer wishing to experience fine dining is expecting a memorable meal experience which incorporates the setting and ambiance of the restaurant, restaurant theatre and outstanding customer care as well as exceptional food.</p>\n\n<p>Strict maintenance of the highest personal and food hygiene and safety are paramount at all times.

      "text": "<p>A hairdresser generally works in the commercial sector, offering a range of services and treatments to the hair for individual clients. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required, and the payment made by the client. Therefore the hairdresser has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the client in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grow the business. Hairdressing is closely associated with other parts of the service sector, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Hairdressing also has an important therapeutic role in supporting individuals&rsquo; self- esteem and confidence. It also helps to relieve the effects of illness, and can aid recovery.</p>\n\n<p>The hairdresser works in diverse environments including large, medium, small, or mobile salons, client homes and in product companies and training institution, film and television productions, theatre, wig work, hair replacement, technicians, session stylists and product research and design. He or she may offer a wide range of services, including cutting, colouring, styling, chemical reformation and special hair treatments. Alternatively, the hairdresser may specialize, for example by becoming either a men&rsquo;s or ladies&rsquo; hairdresser, or a colourist. Irrespective of this, work organization and management, communication and client care, the ability to analyse hair types and conditions, and to work safely and to manufacturers&rsquo; instructions, are the universal attributes of the outstanding hairdresser. In a mobile labour market, the hairdresser may work in teams, or alone, or in both from time to time. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced hairdresser takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the client through scrupulous attention to safe working, to achieving exceptional effects for special occasions, every treatment matters and mistakes are largely irreversible.</p>\n\n<p>With the globalization of visual imagery, the worldwide market in hair and beauty products, and the international mobility of people, the hairdresser faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented hairdresser there are many commercial and international opportunities; however, these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures, trends and hair types. The diversity of skills associated with hairdressing is therefore likely to expand, with the WorldSkills Competition reflecting the skills and attributes of the most outward looking and talented entrants to the sector.</p>\n"

A food service practitioner generally works in the commercial sector, offering a range of services to customers. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required, and the payment made by the guest. Therefore the practitioner has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the guest in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grow the business.</p>\n\n<p>The practitioner is likely to work in a hotel or restaurant. However, the size, nature and quality of these establishments can vary enormously from internationally renowned hotel chains to smaller, privately-owned, more intimate restaurants. The quality and level of service provided and expected by guests will also vary. The styles of service will be dependent on the targeted customer and can range from simple self-service operations to elaborate service styles where dishes can be prepared at the guests&rsquo; table. In its more elaborate form, food and drink service can be likened to a form of theatre.</p>\n\n<p>High quality food and drink service requires the practitioner to have extensive knowledge of international cuisine, beverages and wines. They must have a complete command of accepted serving rules and must know the preparation of speciality dishes and drinks at the guests&rsquo; table or in the bar. The food server is the most important person in attending to the guests and providing the meal experience. Skill and resourcefulness, good manners, excellent interaction with guests, aplomb, excellent personal and food hygiene practices, smart appearance and practical ability are all essential.</p>\n\n<p>A wide range of specialist tools and materials will be used for the service of specialist dishes, drinks and wines. The practitioner will be familiar with their use in addition to the more usual pieces of equipment that are found in most dining situations.</p>\n\n<p>Irrespective of the working environment, excellent communication and customer care skills are universal attributes of the outstanding practitioner. Food service personnel will work as part of a team and with other teams in the hotel or restaurant. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained and experienced practitioner takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. This ranges from safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the guests and colleagues through scrupulous attention to safe and hygienic working practices, to achieving exceptional experiences for special occasions.</p>\n\n<p>With the globalization of gastronomy, the expansion of travel for pleasure and business, and the international mobility of people, staff in the hospitality industry enjoy rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For the talented restaurateur there are many commercial and international opportunities; however, these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures, trends and environments.

This can often be a complex process as each collision will present different degrees and directions of damage. The repaired vehicle must conform to the stringent specifications laid down by the vehicle manufacturer and meet both their tolerances and their safety specifications. An autobody repairer needs to be familiar with mechanical components and their function as well as the specific and often complex safety restraint systems (SRS) fitted to modern vehicles. The autobody repairer returns the vehicle to a condition where it ready for refinishing by a car painter.</p>\n\n<p>An autobody repairer works in a specialist garage dedicated to repair and equipped with the machinery and equipment suitable to repair a wide variety of modern passenger cars.</p>\n\n<p>An autobody repairer&rsquo;s work is often divided between major and minor collision damage; however, skills in both areas may often be used on the same vehicle. In a major collision repair the autobody repairer will mount the vehicle onto a specialized body jig with which he or she can diagnose the direction and extent of the misalignment to the car body structure. He or she then attaches heavy hydraulic pulling equipment to the body and uses this pulling force to reverse the damaging force.</p>\n\n<p>After the misalignment has been rectified to the structure the repairer will normally have to remove damaged structural and non-structural members which are replaced with new sections or part sections using various welding processes and/or riveting and bonding. For a minor collision an autobody repairer may replace or repair non-structural panels to a condition suitable for refinishing with paint.</p>\n\n<p>Repairers must be able to use vehicle body alignment benches and associated measuring equipment (universal and fixed bracket) as a means of assessing the extent of damage and reinstating the structure to its original specifications. An autobody repairer must be a skilled welder who is capable of joining a variety of metals such as low carbon steel, high strength steels or aluminium alloys using metal active gas welding (MAG), tungsten inert gas welding (TIG), and resistance spot welding.</p>\n\n<p>He or she must be able to select the correct consumables for the metal being welded and adjust the machine to provide an efficient high quality weld. In some circumstances body panels may be replaced using bonding and riveting equipment. The repairer must be able to prepare, adjust and use this equipment effectively following manufacturers specifications to reinstate damage panels.</p>\n\n<p>Autobody repairers must be able to remove damaged sections with minimum disruption to surrounding body work and re-attach/re-align the parts to reinstate the integrity of the body shell. These parts or panels may be welded, bolted or riveted.</p>\n\n<p>For minor damage that does not require the replacement of a part or panel an autobody repairer will use a variety of repair tools to remove the damage and reinstate the panel&rsquo;s original contours. These may involve a range of shaped hammers and &lsquo;dollies&rsquo;, bumping files, body files, pry bars and oil stones.</p>\n"

      "text": "<p>The modern Light Vehicle Automobile Technician is likely to be employed in a workshop that is closely associated with one major manufacturer of light vehicles. Their expertise may be greatest with that manufacturer&rsquo;s vehicles; however, depending on the situation and range of services offered by the workshop, they may also handle other manufacturers&rsquo; vehicles. Automobile Technicians also work in garages and workshops that are not associated with particular manufacturers. Where this is the case they may experience a wider range of light vehicles and use alternative equipment, parts and materials.</p>\n\n<p>The trained and competent Light Vehicle Automobile Technician will service and repair a range of light vehicles. For diagnosis, repair and replacement, depending on the nature of the workshop, they may use the manufacturers&rsquo; equipment, parts, materials and procedures. Therefore, according to a workshop&rsquo;s relationship with manufacturers, the Technician&rsquo;s experience may be deep or broad, or both. In every garage and workshop success is measured in time, correct fault finding and repair, and repeat business.</p>\n\n<p>Most garages and workshops are small businesses or cost centres that work to tight financial parameters. The light automobile sector is volatile, being dependent on the wider economy and heavily affected by technological advances and environmental concerns. The highly skilled Automobile Technician keeps abreast of continuous changes in the sector, whether these are to do with performance, safety or green energy sources. They will deeply understand vehicles&rsquo; electrical and electronic systems and their integration; have physical stamina, coordination and kinaesthetic skills, and be versatile. They will be assigned the more complex diagnostic tasks, the most advanced vehicles, and those incorporating the latest technologies. This person may rapidly progress to more senior roles as trainer, supervisor, planner and/or manager.</p>\n"

The technician must be able to maintain and repair internal combustion engines and components, both stationary and mobile, as well as on-highway and off-highway vehicles, both motorized and towed; tracked and rubber-tired equipment; ground-engaging equipment; and earth-moving equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Maintenance and repair can involve individual components or entire systems, requiring the technician to have skill with engines, hydraulics, electronics, braking systems, and much more. The technician must use specific tools to diagnose function, make adjustments, repair or replace defective components or systems, test repairs for proper performance, interpret instructions in technical manuals, write service reports, and ensure that the work meets manufacturers&rsquo; specifications and the requirements of legislation. The technician is frequently the interlocutor between the employer, the customer, and the manufacturer. This experience can allow the technician to advance to senior roles such as trainer, supervisor, or manager.</p>\n\n<p>Although technicians often specialize in certain machines or equipment, either by choice or as a result of employment, the diversity of heavy equipment, along with rapid changes in technology, require broad knowledge and adaptability. Technicians must also be able to work alone or as part of a team, at a variety of hours, and in an employer&rsquo;s shop, a customer&rsquo;s building, or outdoors in urban or rural locations, regardless of weather. Machines often require quick intervention to enable interrupted activity to resume.</p>\n\n<p>The work is most rewarding for those who enjoy working with their hands and are logical, curious and interested in problem solving. The technician also needs good vision, hearing, and sense of smell to diagnose problems. The occupation requires strength and stamina. Proper safety standards must be maintained at all times to avoid risk of injury involved in working on heavy equipment and with power tools.</p>\n"
